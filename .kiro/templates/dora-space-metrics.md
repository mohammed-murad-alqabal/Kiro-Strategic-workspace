## DORA Metrics (DevOps Research and Assessment)

### Core DORA Metrics

#### 1. Deployment Frequency

**Definition**: How often code is deployed to production
**Target**: Daily deployments
**Measurement**: Number of deployments per day/week
**Implementation**:

```bash
# Track deployments
echo "$(date): Deployment to production" >> .kiro/metrics/deployments.log
```

#### 2. Lead Time for Changes

**Definition**: Time from code commit to production deployment
**Target**: < 1 day
**Measurement**: Time between commit and deployment
**Implementation**:

```bash
# Track lead time
COMMIT_TIME=$(git log -1 --format=%ct)
DEPLOY_TIME=$(date +%s)
LEAD_TIME=$((DEPLOY_TIME - COMMIT_TIME))
echo "Lead time: ${LEAD_TIME} seconds" >> .kiro/metrics/lead-time.log
```

#### 3. Change Failure Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of deployments causing failures
**Target**: < 15%
**Measurement**: Failed deployments / Total deployments
**Implementation**:

```bash
# Track deployment success/failure
if [ $DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "$(date): SUCCESS" >> .kiro/metrics/deployment-results.log
else
    echo "$(date): FAILURE" >> .kiro/metrics/deployment-results.log
fi
```

#### 4. Time to Recovery

**Definition**: Time to recover from production failures
**Target**: < 1 hour
**Measurement**: Time from incident detection to resolution
**Implementation**:

```bash
# Track recovery time
INCIDENT_START=$(date +%s)
# ... incident resolution ...
INCIDENT_END=$(date +%s)
RECOVERY_TIME=$((INCIDENT_END - INCIDENT_START))
echo "Recovery time: ${RECOVERY_TIME} seconds" >> .kiro/metrics/recovery-time.log
```

## SPACE Framework (Developer Productivity)

### Core SPACE Dimensions

#### 1. Satisfaction and Well-being

**Definition**: Developer happiness and fulfillment
**Metrics**:

- Developer satisfaction surveys
- Burnout indicators
- Work-life balance metrics
- Team collaboration satisfaction

**Measurement Tools**:

```markdown
## Developer Satisfaction Survey (Monthly)

1. How satisfied are you with your development tools? (1-10)
2. How clear are project requirements? (1-10)
3. How effective is team communication? (1-10)
4. How manageable is your workload? (1-10)
5. How supported do you feel by the team? (1-10)

**Target**: Average score > 7.5
```

#### 2. Performance

**Definition**: Quality and reliability of code outputs
**Metrics**:

- Code review feedback quality
- Bug density in production
- Test coverage percentage
- Code quality scores

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Track code quality metrics
COVERAGE=$(flutter test --coverage | grep -o '[0-9]*\.[0-9]*%' | tail -1)
echo "$(date): Coverage ${COVERAGE}" >> .kiro/metrics/code-quality.log
```

#### 3. Activity

**Definition**: Development work and collaboration patterns
**Metrics**:

- Commits per developer
- Pull request frequency
- Code review participation
- Documentation contributions

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Track development activity
git log --since="1 week ago" --author="$USER" --oneline | wc -l > .kiro/metrics/weekly-commits.log
```

#### 4. Communication and Collaboration

**Definition**: Information flow and knowledge sharing
**Metrics**:

- Code review response time
- Documentation quality
- Knowledge sharing sessions
- Cross-team collaboration

**Measurement**:

```bash
# Track code review response time
PR_CREATED=$(gh pr list --json createdAt --jq '.[0].createdAt')
FIRST_REVIEW=$(gh pr list --json reviews --jq '.[0].reviews[0].submittedAt')
# Calculate response time...
```

#### 5. Efficiency and Flow

**Definition**: Minimal friction and interruptions
**Metrics**:

- Build time optimization
- Development environment setup time
- Context switching frequency
- Blocked time percentage

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Track build times
BUILD_START=$(date +%s)
flutter build apk
BUILD_END=$(date +%s)
BUILD_TIME=$((BUILD_END - BUILD_START))
echo "$(date): Build time ${BUILD_TIME}s" >> .kiro/metrics/build-times.log
```

## Integration with Zero-Trust Security

### Security-Enhanced DORA Metrics

#### Secure Deployment Frequency

- Deployments with security validation
- Vulnerability scanning completion rate
- Security approval time

#### Secure Lead Time

- Time including security reviews
- Security testing duration
- Compliance verification time

#### Security Change Failure Rate

- Deployments causing security incidents
- Security policy violations
- Failed security scans

#### Security Recovery Time

- Time to patch security vulnerabilities
- Incident response time
- Security rollback time

---

## Automated Metrics Collection

### Hooks Integration

#### Pre-commit Hook (Security + Quality)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .kiro/hooks/on-commit/metrics-collection.sh

# Collect code quality metrics
COVERAGE=$(flutter test --coverage 2>/dev/null | grep -o '[0-9]*\.[0-9]*%' | tail -1 || echo "0%")
COMPLEXITY=$(dart analyze --format=json | jq '.diagnostics | length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

# Log metrics
echo "$(date),commit,coverage,$COVERAGE,complexity,$COMPLEXITY" >> .kiro/metrics/quality-metrics.csv
```

#### Post-deployment Hook (DORA Metrics)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .kiro/hooks/post-deploy/dora-metrics.sh

# Calculate lead time
COMMIT_TIME=$(git log -1 --format=%ct)
DEPLOY_TIME=$(date +%s)
LEAD_TIME=$((DEPLOY_TIME - COMMIT_TIME))

# Log DORA metrics
echo "$(date),deployment,lead_time,$LEAD_TIME,status,success" >> .kiro/metrics/dora-metrics.csv
```
