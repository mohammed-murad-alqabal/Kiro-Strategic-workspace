## Zero-Trust Core Principles

### "Never Trust, Always Verify"

- Verify identity and device for every access request
- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Least privilege access enforcement
- Assume breach mentality

## Code Security (Zero-Trust Enhanced)

- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or passwords
- Use secure secret management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs with zero trust
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement continuous authentication and authorization
- Sign and verify all code artifacts before deployment

## Supply Chain Security (Zero-Trust)

- **Dependency Verification**: Scan all dependencies for vulnerabilities (CVSS > 7.0 blocks integration)
- **Artifact Signing**: Sign all build artifacts with organization's private key
- **License Compliance**: Verify all dependency licenses meet organizational policies
- **SBOM Generation**: Generate Software Bill of Materials for all releases
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor dependencies for new vulnerabilities post-deployment
- **Integrity Verification**: Use lock files with cryptographic integrity checks
- **Provenance Tracking**: Maintain complete audit trail of all dependencies

## Data Protection (Zero-Trust Enhanced)

- **Encryption Everywhere**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3+ for data in transit
- **Zero-Trust Network**: No implicit trust based on network location
- **Continuous Session Validation**: Re-verify user identity and device trust continuously
- **Data Classification**: Label and protect data based on sensitivity (Public/Internal/Confidential/Restricted)
- **Secure Headers**: Implement HSTS, CSP, HPKP, and other security headers
- **OWASP Compliance**: Follow OWASP Top 10 and ASVS guidelines
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Monitor and prevent unauthorized data exfiltration

## Infrastructure Security (Zero-Trust Architecture)

- **Identity-Centric Security**: Every access request verified regardless of location
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Network segmentation at granular level with policy enforcement
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and threat detection
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code with version control and audit trails
- **Container Security**: Scan containers for vulnerabilities before deployment
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted, tested, and air-gapped backup strategies
- **Security Audits**: Continuous compliance monitoring and regular penetration testing

## Development Practices (Security-First)

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Automated code security analysis
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Runtime security testing
- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**: Real-time security testing
- **Security Code Reviews**: Mandatory security-focused code reviews
- **Threat Modeling**: Design-time security analysis for all features
- **Security Training**: Regular security awareness and secure coding training
- **Incident Response**: Automated incident detection and response procedures

## Security Metrics and KPIs

### DORA Security Integration

- **Secure Deployment Frequency**: Deployments with security validation
- **Security Lead Time**: Time from security issue identification to resolution
- **Security Change Failure Rate**: Deployments causing security incidents
- **Security Recovery Time**: Time to recover from security incidents

### Zero-Trust Metrics

- **Identity Verification Rate**: Percentage of access requests properly verified
- **Device Trust Score**: Average device trust score across organization
- **Policy Compliance Rate**: Adherence to zero-trust policies
- **Continuous Verification Coverage**: Percentage of systems with continuous verification

### Supply Chain Security Metrics

- **Vulnerability Detection Rate**: Percentage of vulnerabilities caught pre-deployment
- **Artifact Signing Coverage**: Percentage of artifacts properly signed
- **SBOM Completeness**: Software Bill of Materials coverage
- **License Compliance Rate**: Percentage of dependencies with compliant licenses
